# Advent of Code 2018 - (https://adventofcode.com/2018)
This is a collection of my code for the 2018 advent of code. Most of the code is written in Rust, and each day has a crate which can be compiled. 

There is also a script to create a new project for any given day - simply run:
<br>`$ ./setup_day.sh [day]`

The script reads the file `.aocsession` for the session key in order to download the input files for each day. This file is not tracked on git, for obvious reasons, and so you will need to get your own session key if you want to use this code.
